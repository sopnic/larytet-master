http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/ "git magic" - fairly readable and thorough, if longwinded, 3rd party introduction to git

http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitglossary.html official git glossary


http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html and http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial-2.html of the official "git tutorial" - short and to the point, if slightly terse

http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html official git user manual - quite long and comprehensive, yet still slightly terse

http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs official git reference manual - exhaustive online HTML-ized man pages

http://progit.org/book pro git - electronic version of an entire 288-page book
if you are an experienced SCM/VCS and linux/unix user you might want to start off with the "git tutorial", then selectively read "user manual", looking up specific command minutiae in "reference manual".
