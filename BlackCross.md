The Black Cross occurs when a 50-day moving average (MA), which is trending to the downside, crosses the 200-day MA, which at this point is still rising.



  * Liquid stocks are preferable (easier to trade; less likely to gap significantly higher or be bought-out by a larger company; greater supply overhead making it more difficult to digest than a thin name; more pros are shorting along with you, adding to the selling spirits/trend).
  * Former big winners from the previous bull market, 4-to-6 months from their peak, present the optimal Black Cross candidates for selling short.
  * A modest 10-20% is the objective and you cover (I like covering a panic-day by the end of that session, or else the open of the following day, regardless of my percentage gain; I’m looking to grind-out longer and lower if the name is dropping steadily + modestly).
  * As always, benchmarks for stop-loss are a must (while you don’t want to be shaken out of the 1-day-wonder counter-moves, since those are actually good entries, you do need to cover and protect if the name manages more than a couple of days uptrend on strong volume; we’re after easy money here - if you’re sweating then you’re more likely in the wrong place).
