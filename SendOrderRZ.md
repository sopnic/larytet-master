_ErrorType_
> Type of error returned by function call. Error type is defined by OrdersErrorTypes enumeration.

_OrderID_
> Unique order id allocated by taskbar returned by function for order transaction identification. Must be provided when resending order due to user confirmation requirement.

_AuthUserName_
> In the event that the operation requires password authorization, this field will contain the authorizing user name.

_AuthPassword_
> In the event that the operation requires password authorization, this field will contain the password for the authorizing user.

_ReEnteredValue_
> In the event that the operation requires confirmation, the field will contain the value reentered by the user.

**Return Value:**
> The function returns 0 upon success and -1 upon failure.


**Remarks:**
  * This function replaces the SendRezefOrder function providing improved interface and performance.
  * The function requires the Rezef session functionality to be activated - a background thread containing the user's up-to-date market position.
  * The function often requires confirmation from the user and it is therefore important to pay attention to the error type that is returned from the function. The function can then be called a second time with the confirmation details.
