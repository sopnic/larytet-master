A buying climax occurs when a stock makes a new 52-week high and then closes the week lower. A selling climax is the opposite. Climax extremes are thought to represent distribution, from either strong hands to weak (buying climaxes), or weak hands to strong (selling climaxes). A high number of climaxes tend to congregate around market turning points.

In May 5, 2010 there were 1,079 buying climaxes, by far an all-time record. This was the exact opposite reading to that which occurred in March 2009, at the Primary wave 1 (circle) low, when there were 1,010 selling climaxes.
