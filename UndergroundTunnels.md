How to facilitate discovering of the underground tunnels


# Details #

Put in the ground a thin pipe (0.5-1") with small holes in it around the area you want to protect. Via the pipe pump under pressure ionized (marked) gas which is heavier than air. At some distance from the pipe periodically collect samples of the air, ground and water. Compare the maps from different periods. We look for changes in the location where ios are concentrated and relative values of the ion concentration. If there is significant difference in the ion map we can assume that there was a change in the underground topology.

When we approximately know the location (1-2kms) next step is a generator of seismic waves - again we shall compare picture from the past with the current. Now we know the location even better (100s of meters).

Our next step is putting audio sensors and heat sensors, using X-ray and other means to pin point the position of the tunnel to 10s of meters. At this point we can try to disrupt the tunnel
