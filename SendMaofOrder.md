_ErrorType_
> Type of error returned by function call. Error type is defined by OrdersErrorTypes enumeration.

_OrderID_
> Unique order id returned by function for order transaction identification.

_AuthUserName_
> In the event that the operation requires password authorization, this field will contain the authorizing user name.

_AuthPassword_
> In the event that the operation requires password authorization, this field will contain the password for the authorizing user .

_ReEnteredValue_
> In the event that the operation requires confirmation, the field will contain the value reentered by the user.


**Return Value:**
> The function returns 0 upon success and -1 upon failure.

**Remarks:**
  * The function often requires confirmation from the user and it is therefore important to pay attention to the error type that is returned from the function. The function can then be called a second time with the confirmation details.
  * The function call should be preceded by maof session initialization by calling the StartMaofSession function. If the maof session is not initialized, a temporary session is created, and destroyed after sending order.
