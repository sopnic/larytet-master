"In this paper, we show that the combination of QEMU and SystemC can make the co-simulation at the cycle-accurate level extremely fast, even with a full-fledged operating system up and running. Our experimental results indicate that with every instruction executed and every memory accessed since power-on traced at the cycle-accurate level, it takes less than 17 minutes on average to boot up a full-fledged Linux kernel, even on a laptop."

"over 90% of the embedded software verification can be done at the Instruction Accurate (IA) level of software virtual platforms, with simulations running 100s of MIPS. The timing/cycle accurate simulations should be done after IA verification has been finished. This is quite similar to the hardware development methodology, where gate level simulations are done only after RTL simulations are completed."
