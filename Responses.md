Human mind tends to overestimate the expected volatility. While spikes of volatility happen they are extremely rare. Selling of covered puts and covered calls against the existing position makes sense in almost any market conditions. This includes usually rather long periods of waiting for the next volatility spike or periods of doldrum. Periods of doldrum drive the volatility premium lower and make selling options less profitable. Lower profitability is not a viable reason not to do the option writing. In the normal circumstances the premium will far exceed long term interest rates and average dividend rate.

A realistic solution would be a large and extensive network of short distance shuttles. Similar to what you see in Austria, for example. We need a shuttle every 2-5 minutes between each major interchange and all population centers. There is no point to keep a large central station in the  city - I do not work there. I do not need central bus stations at all.  I am ready to switch a shuttle 2-3 times if the shuttles arrive fast . If I travel from Netanya to Petah-Tikva I do not need to enter central bus station in Hod Hasharon. What  I need is 3 shuttles -  Netanya-BeitLid-Morsasha-IndustrialZonePetahTikva. A shuttle which makes minimum number of stops on the way, preferably only two. Such shuttle travels almost as fast as a private car.

Shuttles shall connect population centers with industrial zones and shopping areas. I expect to have a unified electronic ticket and pay the price which depends only on the distance and not on the number of the shuttles.

Naturally such vast network of shuttles can not exist without help of the government. The government assistance is going to be much cheaper than investment in Eilat new airport.

Lapid is rather wrong.

There used to be engines of growth in Israel. Export oriented Israel economy strive when the world economy grew fast. Relatively cheap labor was partially offset by more uniform than now distribution of the profits and large scale social programs.

In the recent 10 years the situation changed completely. With Liquid and specifically Netanyahu corporate tax and tax of the rich went down. Earnings of the middle class - the driving force behind the local demand side of the economy was stagnant at best. Exports could not compensate for the shrinking local demand. Tax collection dropped. In the same time social inequality grew and the lower third of the population got more annoyed.

Lapid bets on the improvement of the world economy which will pull Israel exports with it. This bet I think is dangerous and very likely to fail. The money expansion policies of central banks so far succeeded only to stabilize the world economy. This comes at cost of ~10T USD so far and ~1T USD every year. We should understand that what is going on is pushing the money into the parts of the world economy where expected growths rates are high and ROI is quick. Read short term speculation. Central banks buy time with hope that some change like a jump in productivity will come. The chances are slim. There is not going any improvement in the next 2 years. In the next 2 years Mr. Lapid will increase the taxes once more.

Profits from the natural gas while allow the politicians to show "good life" for some period of time can and will trigger higher inflation rates. In the current situation we have in Israel where more than half of mortgages are ARM mortgages and linked to the BoI interest rate event slightly higher than now inflation will be extremely damaging. The aggregated demand will drop fast inevitable followed by higher UE rates and shrinking tax collection base. Natural gas can turn to be a disaster for Israel if politicians are allowed to manage the money.

You have spent money to keep the government afloat. And when government the money is used in least efficient way. This were you, who did not foresee that the tax collection can fall short. Year after year the same mistake to err on the optimistic side and spend. Political convenience is name of the game.

Dr Zalicha is right.

While in the short term lower interest rates and purchase of USD, and, we shall not forget huge budget deficits, kept the employment rates steady, in the longer term all of this suppressed the demand. Fisher should and could do more to keep the speculation out of the RE. Instead only last two years the BOI did something in this directions and it was both too little and too late. We are going to pay huge price when serving the accumulated debt (we already are paying) and we did not even enjoy too many sunny days. Some rich guys who was leveraged they indeed made lot of money.

Fisher was careless and not mindful of long term results of his policies. He probably has hoped year after year that just a little bit more and he will be able to start to push the rates up. The problems he discovered were more structural and remain to be so.

Dear Lapid,

Your source of information are not reliable at best and misleading at worst. The money Federal Reserve injects into the US economy are failing to gain traction. Those rare signs of improvement like stabilization in the employment rates and positive GDP growth can disappear very soon. You shall not bet on the outcome of the greatest economical experiment in the world history. Instead you need common sense and some imaginations. So far you have not shown neither. You follow the B.A. guys who do not know difference between classic and modern economy schools leave alone any fresh ideas.

Let me give you a couple of examples. Instead of pushing the import tax on cars up you can drop the tax from current 85% to, lets say $35. Instead government can charge 7% annual tax from every car on the road. In the short term You will enjoy a windfall of tax money thanks to the pending demand and steep demand curve. In the long term 7% annual tax will cover all missed taxes.

Instead of taxing the RE you can drop the RE tax to zero for buyers/sellers. Instead you can get progressive annual property tax which starts low at 0.1% and goes up to 7% for the high end properties.

You can drop tax of building materials and, instead, tax construction companies at 7% rate for the land they own. Such would make that companies to build instead of waiting for higher prices.

You could ask where 7% comes from and I will answer that this is expected ROI for a business in the long term which makes a deal worthwhile. When taxing property 7% annual you will route the money from the RE speculation to other areas of economy where expected profitability is lower.
