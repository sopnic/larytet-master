# Normal distribution and real financial markets #

When presented with standard deviations, many assume or don’t realize they are assuming an underlying normal distribution and equate mean plus and minus one standard deviation as  two-thirds probability and mean plus and minus two standard deviations as 95 percent  probability. Financial data is typically nonnormal, exhibiting asymmetry and significantly
more observations several standard deviations from the mean, the so-called ‘‘heavy tails.’’ These tails are heavy only by comparison to the normal distribution, not by what is typical in finance data.

Most errors are trivially avoided by using the empirical distribution—the data itself—rather
than assumed mathematical forms. Moreover, it is quite simple to examine the fit of a normal curve to a set of data and judge the accuracy of probability calculations for intervals of interest, be they in the tail or center of the distribution.

## Return to mean (spread between correlating stocks) ##

  * When the spread increases (decreases) sufficiently far from the mean (say, k standard deviations) sell (buy) the spread.
  * Unwind the positions when the spread returns to the mean.
  * When the spread increases (decreases) sufficiently far from the mean (say, k standard deviations) sell (buy) the spread.
  * Unwind the positions when the spread returns to the mean.

## Choosing pairs ##

Maximizing correlations was an early filter applied to pair selection: Compute the correlation of each candidate pair (using, for example, two years of daily data) and retain only those pairs having correlations greater than some minimum.
It is desirable for risk minimization purposes to select pairs that show similar event histories—peaks and troughs close in time with similar sized moves for the two stocks between these events. Such pairs are less likely to react divergently (except, perhaps, in the immediate aftermath) following a disturbance to the market (political, industrial development, etc.).
