{{{
HRESULT K300StopStream([in] K300StreamType streamType, [out, retval] long* retVal);
}}}

{{{
[C#]
int K300StopStream ( 
    TaskBarLib.K300StreamType streamType ); 
}}}

*Parameters:*
 streamType 
  Streaming can be ceased for either rezef or maof market data. Use either MaofStream or RezefStream as required. 

*Return Value:*
||0 ||: K300 data streaming ceased successfully.||
||-1||  : General function failure. ||
|| -2|| : K300 Data source retrieval failure.||
|| -3||  : K300 Data stream stop failure.||
||  -4||  : Inedequate authorization.||

Remarks:
 * K300StopStream should be called upon completion of data retrieval calls. It appears from the code the StartStream is called when opening a trading session (day) and StopStream after all operation are done. 
 * The K300StartStream and K300StopStream functions are reference counted : ensure that both functions are called an equal number of times. In the VB samples the guys simply keep a global flag - if true the stream is opened. I think that better solution here is state machine. We want to poll the status and if any error repeat stop/start sequence. While in the stop-start cycle no trading is possible and all relevant sub-programs should be paused. 
 * The K300StartStream function should be called in order to start the stream.
