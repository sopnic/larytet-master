*Begins streaming of Market data into the Taskbar from the AS/400 server.*
{{{
HRESULT K300StartStream([in] K300StreamType streamType, [out, retval] long* retVal);
}}}

{{{
[C#]
    int K300StartStream ( 
        TaskBarLib.K300StreamType streamType );
}}}

*Parameters:*
 streamType 
  Streaming can be enabled for either rezef or maof market data. Use either MaofStream or RezefStream as required. 

*Return Value:*
||0 || K300 data streaming started successfully.||
||-1|| General function failure.||
||-2|| K300 Data source initialization failure.||
||-3|| K300 Data stream initialization failure||
||-4|| Inedequate authorization.||

*Remarks:* 
 * Retrieval of market data is a two-stage operation :
  # Initialization of data stream to the taskbar from either K300 Server or AS400 using this method. 
  # Retrieval of market data from taskbar to client application using GetK300RZ | GetK300MF | GetK300Madad methods. Market data can also be relayed to the client application by registering to the K300 event mechanism. 
 * The K300StartStream and K300StopStream functions are reference counted : ensure that both functions are called an equal number of times. 
 * K300StartStream should therefore be called prior to the data retrieval calls.
 * The K300StopStream function should be called in order to close the stream.
