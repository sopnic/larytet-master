 * Dynamic dividend growth model (Campbell-Shiller 1988) 
 * Robustness of return predictability and its potential use from a portfolio allocation perspective (Boudoukh et al. 2008)
 * Ratio of middle-aged to young population explains fluctuations in the dividend yield.  (Geanakopoulos et al. 2004)


Life-cycle portfolio behaviour – which suggests that agents should borrow when young, invest for retirement when middle-aged, and live off their investment once they are retired – plays an important role in determining equilibrium asset prices. Consumption smoothing by the agents, given the assumed demographic structure, requires that when the middle-aged to young population ratio is small, there will be excess demand for consumption by a large cohort of retirees and for the market to clear, equilibrium prices of financial assets should adjust, i.e. decrease. The result is that saving is encouraged for the middle-aged. As the dividend/price ratio is negatively related to fluctuations in prices, he model predicts a negative relation between this variable and the middle-aged-to-young ratio.
