How to pause an application

In Linux you can suspend an application by
> kill -STOP <java process ID>
or, if there are no other java applications running
> killall -STOP java
and resume by
> killall -CONT java

Update your cron script accordingly to do this automatically.

My setup is a hammer candle (defined as a candle with a close in the upper half of the range with a lower shadow at least 2x the real body) and the next bar a break of the high. I place my stop at the low of that candle (daily). My exit rules are at 1.2R (risk) I move stop to breakeven, at 2R I trail a 25% trailing stop, and at 4R I exit on a limit. If I get 3 consecutive closers outside the bollinger I exit on close. If the upper bollinger is flat or fallingI exit at the upper bollinger.

I had 2 positions on because the first one was at breakeven by the time the second setup came around, and exited like this
