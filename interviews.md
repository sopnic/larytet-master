when I interview people I present a problem, such as "given a string that contains an unknown number of words, return a list of each word." It's suprising how many people don't use a std::list.

Then we discuss why they used a particular technique, and how it actually works in passing arguments, returning values, etc. Then we discuss the ramifications such as "well this is called a million times a second, what would you change?"

When I've been interviewed, I've been asked very low level (elementary) questions (copy a string), performance oriented (write a reference counter class that's fast), to non-sensical (calculate a factorial value at compile time using templates).
